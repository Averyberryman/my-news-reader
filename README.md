## Abstract: 
This is a website that displays top headlines in the US by fetching data from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/). This was a take home challenge to simulate a task we might receive during an interview process and complete it within 8 hours. The MVP for this project required displaying a list of articles and then when selected, another page showing more information on the selected article. Users should be able to search, and the site needs to be fully responsive.
